= JBOD storage

TODO: introduction or concept ???

To use JBOD storage, the `type` has to be set to `jbod`.
A JBOD storage is described by one or more volumes and each of them can be an Ephemeral or a Persistent one.

Using the `volumes` property is possible to declare the disks which make the JBOD storage.
