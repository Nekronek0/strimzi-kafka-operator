= JBOD storage

The JBOD storage allows you to provide more volumes to the Kafka brokers to store data.
As well as providing more storage, using multiple disks can improve performance.

To use JBOD storage, the `type` has to be set to `jbod`.
A JBOD storage is described by one or more volumes and each of them can be an xref:ref-ephemeral-storage-{context}[Ephemeral] or a xref:ref-persistent-storage-{context}[Persistent] one.
Each volume declaration follows the same rules and constraints as for Ephemeral and Persistent storage.
For example, it is not possible to change the size for a Persistent storage when it is already provisioned.
The JBOD storage provides a way for putting together more of them.

Using the `volumes` property, it is possible to declare the disks which make the JBOD storage.

.Example fragment of JBOD storage configuration
[source,yaml]
----
# ...
storage:
  type: jbod
  volumes:
  - id: 0
    type: persistent-claim
    size: 100Gi
    deleteClaim: false
  - id: 1
    type: persistent-claim
    size: 100Gi
    deleteClaim: false
# ...
----

It is not possible to change the `id` property for a volume.
It is not possible to add or remove volumes from a JBOD storage configuration.

When Persistent storage is used for declaring volumes, the naming schema for the created Persistent Volume Claims is the following:

`data-_id_-_cluster-name_-kafka-_idx_`::
Persistent Volume Claim for the volume `_id_` used for storing data for the Kafka broker pod `_idx_`.
